# Sponsored Links Blocker for Startpage.com (Firefox Addon)

This Firefox addon hides the "Sponsored" links on the search engine [startpage.com](https://www.startpage.com/) to provide a cleaner and more user-friendly search experience (tested on the German version of startpage).

**Important**: This addon is **unsigned** and will remain unsigned in the future. This means you will need to install it manually, as it is not available through the official Firefox Add-ons marketplace.

## Features

- Removes "Sponsored" links from the search results on **startpage.com**.
- No tracking or data collection â€“ your privacy is preserved.
- Easy to install and use.

## Installation of an Unsigned Addon in Firefox

Since this addon is unsigned, you cannot install it directly from the Firefox Add-ons marketplace. Instead, you need to follow these steps to install it manually:

### Steps:

1. **Download the Addon**: Download the `.xpi` file (the Firefox addon file) from [this page](URL-to-your-addon).

2. **Adjust Firefox Configuration**: To install unsigned addons, you need to make a few changes in the **about:config** settings of Firefox.

    - Type `about:config` in the Firefox address bar and press Enter.
    - Click on "Accept the Risk and Continue" to access the advanced settings.
    - Look for the following setting:
        - **xpinstall.signatures.required**  
          Click on the value and change it to **false** to allow Firefox to install unsigned addons.
          
3. **Install the Addon**:
    - Simply drag and drop the downloaded `.xpi` file into the Firefox window. Alternatively, click on the menu button (three horizontal lines in the upper-right corner), select "Add-ons," and go to "Extensions." There, you'll find an option to "Install Addon from File."
    
4. **Confirmation**: Firefox will ask you if you're sure you want to install the addon. Confirm by clicking "Add."

5. **Activate the Extension**: After installation, you may need to activate the addon. Go to the Add-ons manager and ensure that the addon is enabled.

6. **Done**: Once activated, the "Sponsored" links on **startpage.com** will be hidden immediately.

## Uninstallation

If you wish to remove the addon, you can do so at any time:

1. Go to **Add-ons** in the Firefox settings.
2. Find the addon in the list and click on the **Remove** button.
